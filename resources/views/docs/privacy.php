<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

Preserved Word Ministries ("we") value your ("customer") privacy and the privacy of the visitors to your website ("end users").
We track the number of times your website accesses the API for each day, to prevent over-usage. <br /><br />

We do not store any user-identifiable data on end users.  &nbsp; We do store <u>anonymous</u> form data;
this is needed to generate short URLs that are used to enhance the user's experience, including
the ability to share a link to a search, and allow the browser's back / forward buttons to work
as expected, even within the context of a JavaScript application such as our client software.<br /><br />
