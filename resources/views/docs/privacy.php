<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

Preserved Word Ministries ("we") value your ("customer") privacy and the privacy of the visitors to your website ("end users").
We track the number of times a customer's website accesses the API for each day, to prevent over-usage. <br /><br />

The API does not store any user-identifiable data on end users. &nbsp; We do store <u>anonymous</u> form data;
this is needed to generate short URLs that are used to enhance the user's experience, including
the ability to share a link to a search, and allow the browser's back / forward buttons to work
as expected within the context of a JavaScript application such as our client software.<br /><br />

The API does not collect or store credit card data or other sensitive information. &nbsp; All official client software transmit form data to the API
via HTTPS.<br /><br />
