# Bible SuperSearch API

[BibleSuperSearch.com](https://www.biblesupersearch.com)

Bible SuperSearch Webservice API built using the Laravel framework.
This API, when combined with a User Interface (UI), allows you to use Bible SuperSearch entirely on your website, not dependent on ours.

#### This software includes the following:
* Full Bible search engine functionality
* Webservice API for accessing this functionality
* API documentation
* Administrative backend
* Installer

#### This does NOT include:
* A User Interface (UI) for the Bible search engine

We reccommend our pre-built user interface, which is available both as a universal client and as a WordPress plugin.
These can be downloaded here: [Download](http://www.biblesupersearch.com/downloads)
You also have the option to build  your own.
